# KawiGo-E-Mobility-Solution-for-East-Africa

KawiGo is a comprehensive software ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between electric motorcycle riders and battery swap infrastructure in East Africa. This project was developed between June and September 2025 as my final capstone, earning Top of Class honors.

# System Architecture
The platform is built as a distributed system to ensure both mobile accessibility for riders and robust management for operators.

1. Mobile App (Flutter)
The rider-facing interface allows for real-time station discovery and battery status monitoring.
Key Features: Google Maps integration, real-time station filtering, and user authentication.
Stack: Flutter, Dart.

2. Admin Dashboard (Web)
A central hub for fleet managers and swap station operators to monitor system health.
Key Features: Station management, rider analytics, and operational oversight.
Stack: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript.

3. Backend API & Database
The engine that powers the ecosystem, handling data persistence and business logic.
Key Features: Relational database design, secure API endpoints for mobile/web communication.
Stack: PHP, MySQL (managed via phpMyAdmin).

# Key Achievements
Top of Class of my Software Development cohort for the technical complexity and social relevance of this project.
Recognition: Selected as a finalist in the 2025 GreenTech Hackathon out of hundreds of entries.
User-Centric Design: Focused on reducing "range anxiety" for e-motorcycle riders, potentially saving hours of downtime per week.
