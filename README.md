# KawiGo-E-Mobility-Solution-for-East-Africa

KawiGo is a comprehensive software ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between electric motorcycle riders and battery swap infrastructure in East Africa. This project was developed between June and September 2025 as my final capstone, earning Top of Class honors.

# System Architecture
The platform is built as a distributed system to ensure both mobile accessibility for riders and robust management for operators.

1. [Mobile App (Flutter)]([url](https://github.com/kareenino/kawi-mobile-flutter))

The rider-facing interface allows for real-time station discovery and battery status monitoring.
Key Features: Google Maps integration, real-time station filtering, and user authentication.
Stack: Flutter, Dart.

2. [Web Platform & Admin Portal]([url](https://github.com/kareenino/kawi-web-frontend))

A dual-purpose web solution that serves as the public landing page and the secure operational hub.
The Site: Public-facing information about the KawiGo mission.
Admin Dashboard: A secure portal (integrated within the site) for operators to manage fleet logistics, station health, and user data.
Stack: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.

3. [Backend API & Database]([url](https://github.com/kareenino/kawi-web-backend))

The engine that powers the ecosystem, handling data persistence and business logic.
Key Features: Relational database design, secure API endpoints for mobile/web communication.
Stack: PHP, MySQL (managed via phpMyAdmin).
